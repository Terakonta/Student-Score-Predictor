To generate data, do the following:

1) Run the neural network, and output the results to a file 
Make sure to run the script in a virtualenv with all the requirements installed.

python neural_network.py > data/output.txt 

2) Edit the main() function in nn_helper.py to point to the data file and to change the title of the graph.

3) Two graphs will appear in windows, one after the other.
Save these graphs and close the window to open the next graph.
